You interact with AI every day—through chatbots, translation apps, or even your phone’s autocomplete. The "brain" behind these tools is a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. But how do you actually build one?

It turns out the process isn’t so different from how a person learns: first a broad education, then specialized training, and finally a check to make sure the student can apply knowledge well. For LLMs, this journey happens in **three stages**:  

1. **Building the model architecture and preparing the data**  
2. **Pretraining on massive, unlabeled text**  
3. **Finetuning for specialized tasks**  

Let’s break down each stage.

*Figure 1: The three-stage process of building and training Large Language Models.*


## Stage 1: Building the LLM (Data + Architecture)

Every LLM begins with three critical components:

- **Data preparation & sampling** – breaking down massive amounts of text into tokens the model can process.  
- **Attention mechanism** – the core idea behind transformers, allowing the model to “pay attention” to the most relevant words in a sequence.  
- **LLM architecture** – the actual neural network structure, usually based on the GPT-style transformer decoder.  

This stage is about **implementation**: coding the attention mechanism, designing the model layers, and setting up the data pipeline. The result is not yet a useful AI assistant—it’s just the skeleton of an LLM, ready to be trained.


## Stage 2: Pretraining – Building a Foundation Model

Next comes **pretraining**, which is like giving the model the biggest library in the world.  

The model is fed trillions of words of **unlabeled text** (books, articles, websites, research papers). Its simple task is, **predict the next word in a sentence.**

**Example**: given **"Peanut butter and ___"**, the model learns to predict **"jelly."**  

This is **self-supervised learning**—the labels come from the data itself. Through countless predictions, the LLM begins to capture:  

- Grammar and sentence structure  
- Factual knowledge  
- Contextual patterns  
- Basic reasoning skills  

And here’s the surprising part: **even though the task is simple, scaling it up leads to emergent abilities**. Models trained only on next-word prediction have demonstrated unexpected skills like translation, summarization, and reasoning—capabilities never explicitly programmed.

Key components in this stage include:  

- **Training loop** – iteratively updating weights through backpropagation.  
- **Model evaluation** – checking how well the model predicts new text during training.  
- **Pretrained weights** – saving and reloading learned parameters for reuse.  

The result is a **foundation model**: a reusable base model with broad knowledge, but no specialization yet.


## Stage 3: Finetuning – Specializing the Foundation Model

If pretraining is like college, **finetuning** is job training.  
We take the foundation model and adapt it for a **specific task** using smaller, **labeled datasets**.  

There are two common finetuning pathways:

### 1. Fine-tuning for Classification  
- Dataset: inputs + class labels (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  
- Output: a **classifier** that can categorize new text.  

### 2. Fine-tuning for Instruction Following  
- Dataset: instruction–response pairs (e.g., “Translate to French → Bonjour”).  
- Output: a **personal assistant / chat model** that can follow instructions.  

This distinction is critical: **classification finetuning** produces narrow tools, while **instruction finetuning** creates assistants like ChatGPT that can handle open-ended prompts.  

This step is also far more **efficient** than pretraining. Instead of starting from scratch, we reuse pretrained weights and adapt them. In practice, companies often use techniques like **parameter-efficient finetuning (e.g., LoRA)** to reduce cost even further.


## Where Does Evaluation Fit In?

You might wonder: what about **evaluation**?  
Evaluation isn’t its own stage but is woven throughout **Stage 2 and Stage 3**:

- During **pretraining**, we evaluate with **loss** and **perplexity** (a measure of how well the model predicts sequences).  
- During **finetuning**, we evaluate task-specific metrics such as:  
  - **Accuracy** (classification tasks)  
  - **BLEU scores** (translation tasks)  
  - **Human preference ratings** (instruction-following models)  

This “final exam” ensures the model is reliable before being deployed.
